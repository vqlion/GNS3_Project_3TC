The goal is to automate the configuration of routers. We feed a script an intent file with the parameters of the AS, as well as the description of the architecture of the network, and the script generates the configuration files for each router automatically.
## Usage
The intent and architecture files must be formatted as the ones in the [intent files folder](./intent_files/). 

```python3 config.py intent_file_path```
